## Getting Started

Compile java files and start the program using this command:
```bash
javac -d bin src/*.java && java -cp bin/ Model
```

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `bin`: the folder containing output files that will be generated
